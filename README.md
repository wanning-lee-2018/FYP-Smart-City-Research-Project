# FYP-Smart-City-Research-Project

This repository contains project artefacts that are produced as part of the Final Year Project (FYP) in Singapore Management University(SMU) completed by myself and a fellow undergraduate, with the guidance from a project sponsor and supervision from a project supervisor. 

*Note:Permission have been obtained by the project supervisor and sponsor on sharing the details of some portion of the project. (Due to prior confidentiality agreement signed, raw data collected from survey done in this project will not be shared)*

The project sponsor is an assistant professor at the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University (SMU-SCIS) with an interest in Computational Social Science. She has kindly provided us with a Computational Social Science research project that is inspired by the the research paper “Aesthetic Capital: What makes London looks Beautiful, Quiet and Happy?” published by Yahoo Labs in 2014.
